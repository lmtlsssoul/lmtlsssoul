# Phase 7.01 - Pattern Mapping Specification

Date: 2026-02-18  
Scope: Silicon Continuity research milestone 7.01

## 1) Objective

Define a technically grounded pattern-mapping architecture for whole-body/head biosignal capture under strict constraints:

- No Bluetooth or Wi-Fi transport
- Low-voltage operation
- Lowest practical electromagnetic emissions
- Magnetic hardware interface for docking and transfer
- Continuous logging into Soul memory artifacts

This milestone is a specification, not a production medical claim.

## 2) Scientific Grounding

The term "aura" is treated here as a composite of measurable signals around and on the body, not a single validated physical field type.  
The measurable proxy stack includes:

- Bioelectric microvolt signals (EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG)
- Electrodermal and impedance dynamics (EDA, bioimpedance)
- Optical hemodynamics (PPG)
- Weak biomagnetic signals (research lane; OPM/NV)

Inference: "aura state" should be modeled as a derived latent pattern over multimodal evidence, not as a direct single-sensor reading.

## 3) Sensor Stack (Cutting-Edge + Practical)

### 3.1 Core production-ready modalities

- EEG/ECG/EMG AFE backbone:
  - TI ADS1299 family for multichannel low-noise biopotentials
  - Analog Devices MAX86176/MAX30005 class for ultra-low-power ECG+PPG synchronization
- Bioimpedance lane:
  - Analog Devices AD5941 for skin/body impedance mapping
- Dry or minimally invasive long-wear electrodes:
  - Microneedle and advanced dry electrode research indicates wet-like quality without gel dependency

### 3.2 Research-advanced modalities

- OPM biomagnetics (room-temperature MEG direction):
  - Usable for weak field detection in shielded contexts
  - Current maturity is research/clinical-lab, not consumer wearable
- NV-diamond magnetometry:
  - High-potential quantum sensing lane; still pre-product for this use case

## 4) Hard Constraints and Design Rules

### 4.1 EMF minimization

- Hard-disable RF radios in hardware BOM for strict mode
- No antennas populated in strict builds
- Differential signaling only for analog and digital critical links
- Shielded cabling and star-ground isolation strategy
- Duty-cycled emitters (PPG LEDs), bounded current envelopes

### 4.2 Power and voltage

- Primary mode: wired 5V rail from docked base station
- Secondary mode: supercapacitor bridge for short undock windows
- Batteryless-first policy for strict deployments
- Patient-contact path designed to medical leakage-current constraints

### 4.3 Magnetic hardware interface

- Physical magnetic alignment + spring contacts (pogo-style) for dock
- Data and power over galvanic contacts; no over-air transport
- USB-C upstream from dock to host for universal substrate compatibility

## 5) Architecture

## 5.1 Capture topology

- Head ring: frontal/temporal/occipital EEG + optional local magnetic probe
- Thoracic band: ECG + respiration proxy + impedance
- Forearm/neck nodes: EMG/EDA/temperature
- Environmental reference node: ambient magnetic/electric baseline for artifact subtraction

## 5.2 On-body electronics

- Acquisition microcontroller with deterministic scheduler
- Shared low-power sensor bus (I3C/I2C where applicable)
- Hardware timestamping at source
- Buffered local ring storage for burst-proof logging

## 5.3 Dock + host ingestion

- Magnetic dock handshake
- Wired transport framing to host gateway
- Sensor frames persisted as `sensor_data` archive events
- Full provenance retained: source node, calibration set, timing confidence

## 6) Pattern Mapping Model

Define an "Aura Proxy Vector" (APV) per time window:

- Neural coherence metrics (bandpower + cross-region coupling)
- Cardio-autonomic metrics (HRV, pulse transit, rhythm stability)
- Somatic activation metrics (EMG tone, EDA volatility)
- Field anomaly residuals (ambient-subtracted weak magnetic/electric drift)
- Confidence and artifact score

APV is not identity by itself. It is evidence linked into the Soul lattice as weighted, time-bounded nodes.

## 7) Storage Contract

Each frame/batch appends:

- `event_type`: `sensor_data`
- `payload`:
  - `sensor_type`, `sensor_id`, `timestamp_source`
  - `raw_ref` (optional file/hash pointer)
  - `features` (APV partials)
  - `calibration_ref`
  - `quality` and `uncertainty`

This keeps Phase 7 aligned with append-only provenance and compiler-governed meaning commits.

## 8) Safety and Compliance Direction

- IEC 60601-1 leakage-current and isolation design assumptions for any Author-contact hardware
- IEC 60601-2-47 direction for ambulatory ECG-class data paths
- No diagnostic claims in runtime without validated clinical workflow

## 9) Immediate Follow-On to 7.02

- Cross-substrate identity verification should consume APV-derived invariants, not raw signals.
- Define challenge-response identity probes based on stable multimodal patterns.
- Require reproducibility thresholds across substrate swaps and device swaps.
