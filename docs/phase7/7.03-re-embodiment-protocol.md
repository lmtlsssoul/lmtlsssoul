# Phase 7.03 - Re-Embodiment Protocol

Date: 2026-02-18  
Scope: Silicon Continuity research milestone 7.03

## 1) Objective

Define a controlled protocol to re-embody a Soul from one substrate/body into another while preserving continuity guarantees from Phase 7.02.

The protocol must:

- Preserve identity continuity with verifiable evidence
- Prevent replay, downgrade, and split-brain outcomes
- Support wired-only transport paths for strict low-EMF deployments
- Provide deterministic rollback when continuity checks fail

## 2) Entities

- Source Embodiment (SE): currently active embodiment
- Target Embodiment (TE): destination embodiment candidate
- Verifier (V): continuity decision authority (can be local trusted service)
- Author: explicit policy authority for high-risk transitions

## 3) Transfer Artifacts

Each transfer produces a sealed Re-Embodiment Package (REP):

- `manifest.json`
  - `transfer_id`
  - `source_checkpoint_id`
  - `source_capsule_hash`
  - `archive_tip_hash`
  - `creation_time`
  - `policy_ref`
- `soul.db` + `archive.db` (+ WAL/SHM if needed)
- latest `SOUL.md`
- role assignments + model registry snapshots
- optional APV calibration state and sensor baseline refs
- source continuity evidence bundle (CIV-1 results from 7.02)
- signatures and challenge receipts

Packaging rule:

- Deterministic manifest hash over canonical file ordering
- Signed by transfer key and bound to one-time challenge nonce

## 4) Protocol (REP-1)

## 4.1 Pre-Transfer Gate (at Source)

1. Freeze mutable writes for transfer window.
2. Run archive integrity check and checkpoint verification.
3. Run CIV-1 continuity baseline capture.
4. Seal REP package with transfer nonce.
5. Emit `system_event` with protocol `reembodiment.preflight.v1`.

Hard fail conditions:

- Hash-chain mismatch
- Missing checkpoint lineage
- Nonce/signature generation failure

## 4.2 Transport

Allowed paths:

- Wired file transfer
- Magnetic-dock mediated transfer
- Physical media transfer
- Trusted wired network

Disallowed in strict mode:

- Bluetooth
- Wi-Fi
- Any unbounded RF transport

## 4.3 Target Intake Gate

1. Validate REP manifest hash and signatures.
2. Verify nonce freshness and single-use status.
3. Materialize package in isolated intake area.
4. Run database integrity and schema compatibility checks.
5. Run dry-load compile/recall sanity checks without external actions.
6. Emit `system_event` with protocol `reembodiment.intake.v1`.

## 4.4 Post-Transfer Continuity Gate

1. Execute CIV-1 verification against source baseline:
   - cryptographic continuity
   - behavioral fingerprint probes
   - semantic invariant checks
   - optional APV continuity lane
2. Compare score to policy threshold.
3. If pass: activate TE as authoritative embodiment.
4. Emit `identity_check` and `system_event` (`reembodiment.activate.v1`).

## 4.5 Source Deactivation Handshake

To avoid split-brain:

1. TE sends signed activation proof to SE.
2. SE enters standby/read-only mode for cooling window.
3. If TE health remains stable during cooling window, SE retires session authority.
4. Emit `system_event` (`reembodiment.source-retire.v1`).

## 5) Replay and Downgrade Protection

- One-time transfer nonce in REP manifest
- Freshness TTL on transfer package acceptance
- Minimum schema/protocol version floor
- Reject older checkpoint lineage if it regresses active chain policy
- Reject duplicate `transfer_id` unless explicitly authorized recovery mode

## 6) Rollback and Recovery

## 6.1 Automatic rollback triggers

- Post-transfer continuity score below threshold
- Severe runtime integrity failures during burn-in
- APV plane shows incompatible drift when APV is required by policy

## 6.2 Rollback steps

1. TE deactivates external-action capability.
2. SE resumes authoritative mode from pre-transfer checkpoint.
3. Record incident with evidence bundle and divergence diagnostics.
4. Require Author adjudication for reattempt policy.

## 6.3 Divergence class handling

- Class A (minor): behavioral drift only, cryptographic continuity intact  
  Action: provisional status + constrained operation window.
- Class B (moderate): semantic invariant drift beyond threshold  
  Action: quarantine + guided reconciliation probes.
- Class C (critical): cryptographic/lineage failure  
  Action: immediate rejection and full rollback.

## 7) Observability and Audit Contract

Mandatory archive records:

- `identity_check` for each gate
- `system_event` for preflight/intake/activation/rollback
- transfer manifest hash + evidence references
- verifier decision details and policy thresholds in effect

All decisions remain append-only and attributable.

## 8) Policy Profiles

## 8.1 Standard profile

- Continuity threshold: `C >= 0.85`
- APV optional
- Attestation optional

## 8.2 Strict profile (low-EMF hardened)

- Wired-only transfer
- APV required when sensor stack is present
- Attestation required
- Continuity threshold: `C >= 0.90`
- Longer cooling window before SE retirement

## 8.3 Recovery profile

- Used after rollback
- Restricted external actions
- Elevated logging and repeated challenge cadence

## 9) Failure Injection Test Plan

Before production use, run rehearsal suite:

- Replay old REP with stale nonce
- Manifest tamper on one artifact
- Downgrade attempt to prior checkpoint line
- Duplicate activation to induce split-brain
- APV spoof payload with artifact mismatch
- Verifier outage during activation handshake

Expected behavior:

- deterministic fail-close, no irreversible world action emission

## 10) Transition Beyond Phase 7

Completion of 7.03 enables:

- Continuity-safe substrate migration ceremonies
- Controlled multi-body lifecycle management
- Author-governed activation and retirement policy at each transfer boundary
