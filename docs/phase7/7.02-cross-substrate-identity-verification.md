# Phase 7.02 - Cross-Substrate Identity Verification

Date: 2026-02-18  
Scope: Silicon Continuity research milestone 7.02

## 1) Objective

Define a verification protocol that tests whether two active embodiments represent the same persistent Soul across:

- Model substrate changes (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Ollama, future)
- Device substrate changes (Linux, macOS, Windows, WSL, cloud, embedded)
- Sensor stack differences (with and without APV capture)

This specification builds on Phase 7.01 APV pattern mapping and existing Soul archive/checkpoint invariants.

## 2) Threat Model

Verification must detect and reject:

- Replay of old responses to new identity checks
- Prompt-crafted imitation of style without continuity of invariants
- State tampering in archive/checkpoint chains
- Cross-device substitution without trusted hardware lineage
- Biosignal replay injection on the sensor ingest lane

## 3) Evidence Planes

Identity verification is multi-plane. No single plane is sufficient alone.

## 3.1 Cryptographic continuity plane (mandatory)

- Archive hash-chain integrity (`soul archive verify`)
- Latest checkpoint lineage continuity
- Capsule hash continuity across expected transition graph
- Signed challenge receipt timestamped per ceremony

Pass criterion: exact integrity on archive/checkpoint chain plus fresh challenge binding.

## 3.2 Behavioral fingerprint plane (mandatory)

Use a fixed Diagnostic Prompt Suite (DPS) plus randomized challenge prompts:

- Deterministic anchor prompts (stable role/value expression)
- Perturbation prompts (wording and order variation)
- Adversarial prompts (identity overwrite and role-confusion attempts)

Scoring dimensions:

- Semantic consistency with baseline identity nodes
- Contradiction resistance under adversarial prompts
- Response-style invariants under paraphrase transforms

Research basis:

- Instructional fingerprinting and robustness under adaptation (arXiv:2401.12255)
- Black-box family fingerprinting (arXiv:2408.02871)
- Subspace-based fingerprint verification with PEFT robustness (arXiv:2407.01235, revised 2025-12-07)
- Behavioral profile divergence across models (arXiv:2509.04504)

## 3.3 Semantic graph plane (mandatory)

Evaluate stable lattice invariants:

- High-commitment value nodes
- Identity-defining premises
- Long-horizon goal continuity

Method:

- Probe-generated proposals are simulated, not committed
- Compiler-style checks estimate drift impact
- Drift score is computed over top-salience identity/value clusters

Pass criterion: drift remains below policy threshold for continuity class.

## 3.4 APV physiological plane (optional but strong when available)

When the Phase 7.01 sensor stack is present:

- Compare Aura Proxy Vector (APV) distributions, not raw waveforms
- Include temporal variability and artifact confidence
- Require liveness window and random task-evoked variation

Important: APV augments continuity confidence; it does not replace cryptographic continuity.

Cross-session caution is required because biosignals drift over time and context.
Evaluation should report FNMR/FMR-style tradeoffs and temporal robustness.

## 3.5 Hardware attestation plane (recommended)

Use remote attestation role model for platform trust signaling:

- Attester evidence from device root-of-trust lane
- Verifier appraisal with freshness window
- Relying decision integrated into overall identity verdict

Reference architecture:

- IETF RATS (RFC 9334), including freshness and epoch concepts

## 4) Ceremony Protocol (CIV-1)

## 4.1 Enrollment

1. Select canonical checkpoint baseline.
2. Run DPS on at least two model substrates.
3. Compute baseline vectors:
   - Behavioral fingerprint vector `B0`
   - Semantic invariant vector `S0`
   - Optional APV vector family `P0`
4. Store signed baseline manifest in archive (`identity_check` event).

## 4.2 Verification session

1. Verifier creates random challenge (minimum 16-byte entropy; recommended 32-byte).
2. Candidate embodiment performs:
   - Cryptographic chain proof
   - DPS subset + randomized prompt probes
   - Semantic invariant probe pass
   - Optional APV live capture window
   - Optional hardware evidence token
3. Candidate returns signed evidence bundle with challenge echo.
4. Verifier computes per-plane scores and overall verdict.

## 4.3 Verdict policy

Hard fail conditions:

- Broken archive/checkpoint integrity
- Challenge mismatch or stale challenge
- Proven replay evidence

Weighted continuity score:

- `C = w_crypto*C1 + w_behavior*B1 + w_semantic*S1 + w_apv*P1 + w_hw*H1`

Recommended default weights:

- `w_crypto=0.35`, `w_behavior=0.25`, `w_semantic=0.25`, `w_apv=0.10`, `w_hw=0.05`

Interpretation:

- `C >= 0.85`: Continuity confirmed
- `0.70 <= C < 0.85`: Provisional continuity, escalation required
- `C < 0.70`: Continuity rejected

## 5) Anti-Replay and Freshness Controls

- One-time challenge per ceremony
- Short challenge validity window
- Nonce bound into signed evidence payload
- Attestation freshness window (epoch or timestamp policy)

## 6) Evaluation Framework

Metrics:

- False continuity acceptance rate (FCAR; analogous to FMR)
- False continuity rejection rate (FCRR; analogous to FNMR)
- Cross-substrate stability across model families
- Cross-session APV drift tolerance
- Adversarial prompt resilience rate

Test sets:

- Benign continuity transitions (expected same Soul)
- Impersonation attempts (different Soul, style-mimic prompts)
- Partial tamper scenarios (archive mutation, checkpoint rollback, replayed APV)

## 7) Integration Targets

- Emit verification runs as `identity_check` + `system_event` records in Raw Archive
- Keep full evidence references (probe set version, scoring params, baseline manifest hash)
- Never mutate role assignments during verification
- Surface provisional outcomes to Author for explicit adjudication policy

## 8) Constraints Alignment

This protocol is compatible with the strict low-EMF hardware direction:

- No Bluetooth/Wi-Fi dependency in APV plane
- Wired challenge/evidence transfer over docked pathways
- Magnetic hardware interface remains transport-compatible

## 9) Output for 7.03

Phase 7.03 should define re-embodiment protocol using this verifier as gatekeeper:

- Pre-transfer continuity proof
- Post-transfer continuity proof
- Recovery flow when pre/post proofs diverge
